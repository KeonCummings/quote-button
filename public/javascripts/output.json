        "      “I must say a word about fear. It is life's only true opponent. Only fear can defeat life. It is a clever, treacherous adversary, how well I know. It has no decency, respects no law or convention, shows no mercy. It goes for your weakest spot, which it finds with unnerving ease. It begins in your mind, always ... so you must fight hard to express it. You must fight hard to shine the light of words upon it. Because if you don't, if your fear becomes a wordless darkness that you avoid, perhaps even manage to forget, you open yourself to further attacks of fear because you never truly fought the opponent who defeated you.”   ",
        "      “Half the world is composed of people who have something to say and can't, and the other half who have nothing to say and keep on saying it.”   ",
        "      “Only dull people are brilliant at breakfast.”   ",
        "      “Sometimes I’m terrified of my heart; of its constant hunger for whatever it is it wants. The way it stops and starts.”   ",

        "      “You can't just turn on creativity like a faucet. You have to be in the right mood. What mood is that? Last-minute panic.”   ",
        "      “Life is one big road with lots of signs. So when you riding through the ruts, don't complicate your mind. Flee from hate, mischief and jealousy. Don't bury your thoughts, put your vision to reality. Wake Up and Live!”   ",
        "      “And then I felt sad because I realized that once people are broken in certain ways, they can't ever be fixed, and this is something nobody ever tells you when you are young and it never fails to surprise you as you grow older as you see the people in your life break one by one. You wonder when your turn is going to be, or if it's already happened.”   ",

        "      “It would seem that Our Lord finds our desires not too strong, but too weak. We are half-hearted creatures, fooling about with drink and sex and ambition when infinite joy is offered us, like an ignorant child who wants to go on making mud pies in a slum because he cannot imagine what is meant by the offer of a holiday at the sea. We are far too easily pleased.”   ",

        "      “We are all going, I thought, and it applies to turtles and turtlenecks, Alaska the girl and Alaska the place, because nothing can last, not even the earth itself.  The Buddha said that suffering was caused by desire, we'd learned, and that the cessation of desire meant the cessation of suffering.  When you stopped wishing things wouldn't fall apart, you'd stop suffering when they did.”   ",
